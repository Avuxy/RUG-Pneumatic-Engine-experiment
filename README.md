# RUG-Pneumatic-Engine-experiment

An collection of files used for pneumatic engine Experiment at the Rijksuniversiteit of Groningen.

For the installation make sure to install the latest code, older code is also avaible. The CAD files are limited to the ones in my possesion. 
All data obtained with the experiment can be found in the data section and is available for use in future work.

Good luck with this project and have fun!



**Instructions for performing the experiment**
These are the install instructions for the summer 2024 python variant of the pneumatic engine experiment,

1. install latest version of Python and Arduino IDE.
2. Download latest code and unzip files
3. Verify and upload ArduinoADC code with Arduino IDE
4. Install python packages on local device
5. Check baud rate and COM ports, 1 way to do this is Dynamixel wizard for Servo engines.
6. Specifiy result folder, default is windows desktop.

If errors occur feel free to reach out, in addition more information is avaible in the research paper.
